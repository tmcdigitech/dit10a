Create a flask web app (or use an existing one) that has the following features:

- when I go to `/name/Barry`, it will remember my name is Barry.
- when I go to `/name/15`, it will remember my age is 15.
- when I go to `/licence`, it will either show:
> Hello Barry. You will be eligible to get your licence in 1 year.

or, if the age I entered was at least 16, it will instead show:
> Hello Barry. You are eligible to apply for your licence. 

- Also, if the age entered is at least 15, it should add:
> Would you like to practise for your test?
