Create a flask web app (or use an existing one) that has the following features:

- when I go to `/name/Barry`, it will remember my name is Barry.
- when I go to `/age/15`, it will remember my age is 15.
- when I go to `/licence`, it will either show:
> Hello Barry. You will be eligible to get your licence in 1 year.

or, if the age I entered was at least 16, it will instead show:
> Hello Barry. You are eligible to apply for your licence. 

- Also, if the age entered is at least 15, it should add:
> Would you like to practise for your test?

The phrase "apply for your licence" should be a link to here:

And the phrase "practise for your test" should be a link to here:

- [https://www.mylicence.sa.gov.au/my-car-licence/practice-theory-test](https://www.mylicence.sa.gov.au/my-car-licence/practice-theory-test)
