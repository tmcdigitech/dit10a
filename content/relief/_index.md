Hi folks. We started converting our todo list into a cookbook yesterday. (What a perfectly normal English sentence that is!)

Here are some videos of those steps and the next ones, to help you with how you might adapt an existing project into something new.
And as you've probably guessed, that is exactly what your next task will be!

You may be in class before I complete this list, so check back from time to time to see if I add more...

If you're feeling confident, see if you can adapt the demo into your own page, and perhaps try changing the layout a bit with some heavy googling.
